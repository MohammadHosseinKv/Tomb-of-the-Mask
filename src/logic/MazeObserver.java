/**
 * The {@code MazeObserver} interface defines a contract for objects that need to be notified
 * about changes occurring to a {@link Player} within a maze. Implementing classes should provide
 * specific behavior in response to these changes, such as updating the user interface, logging
 * events, or triggering game logic.
 *
 * <p>This interface follows the Observer design pattern, allowing observers to be updated whenever
 * the state of the player changes in the maze. Implementations of this interface are typically
 * used in conjunction with a {@link Maze} class or similar to observe player movements, status
 * changes, or other relevant events.</p>
 *
 * <p>Common use cases for this interface include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Tracking the player's position within the maze.</li>
 *     <li>Reacting to specific player actions, such as collecting items or encountering obstacles.</li>
 *     <li>Updating visual or auditory feedback based on the player's state.</li>
 * </ul>
